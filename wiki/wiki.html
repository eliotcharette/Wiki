        <p> The Croats arrived in the area of present-day Croatia during the 6th century AD.
          They organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century. Tomislav
          became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom.
          The Kingdom of Croatia retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries,
          reaching its peak during the rule of Kings Petar Krešimir IV and Dmitar Zvonimir.
          Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102. In 1527, faced with
          Ottoman conquest, the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of the House of
          Habsburg to the Croatian throne.During the early 19th century, parts of the
          country were split into the French
          Illyrian Provinces, and Austria-Hungary occupied its Bosnia and Herzegovina
          side–a dispute settled by the 1878 Treaty of Berlin.
